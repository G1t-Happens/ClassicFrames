# ClassicFrames(Colored) - World of Warcraft AddOn
This Retail AddOn restores the Pre-10.0 UI frames with a focus on PvP, minimalism, and performance.
<br>This AddOn is based on and inspired by the original [ClassicFrames](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classic-frames) AddOn by luckfore.
<br>The focus of this AddOn was on coloring the name frame backgrounds, minimalism, and performance,
<br>which is why it includes only a small portion of the features of the original addon.

## Installation:
1. Download ZIP from GitHub
2. Extract the ClassicFrames-main into the `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` Folder
3. Rename the extracted Folder from ClassicFrames-main to ClassicFrames
4. After you've installed ClassicFrames in the AddOns folder, go into your **TEXTURES** folder
<br>inside your ClassicFrames and transfer the **RaidFrame** und **TargetingFrame** folder to your interface folder.
The default path for your interface folder is `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface`
> [!NOTE]  
> The textures you transfer from the TEXTURE folder to the Interface folder are meant to align the **RaidFrames** and 
> **Nameplates** with the textures of the Unitframes. If you have no interest or need for this, you can safely skip step 4.
5. You are done with the installation.

## FAQ:

**<br>Does this work on Retail or Classic ?**
<br>Retail only !

**<br>Are you going to keep updating the addon for Retail?**
<br>I'm doing my best to keep the addon up to date, but it's challenging with all the recent changes from Blizzard :(
