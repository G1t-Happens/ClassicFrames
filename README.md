# ClassicFrames(Colored) - World of Warcraft AddOn
This Retail AddOn restores the Pre-10.0 UI frames with a focus on PvP, minimalism, and performance.
<br>This AddOn is based on and inspired by the original [ClassicFrames](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classic-frames) AddOn by luckfore.
<br>The focus of this AddOn was on coloring the name frame backgrounds, minimalism, and performance, which is why it
<br>includes only a small portion of the features of the original addon.

## FAQ:

**<br>Does this work in Retail or Classic era?**
<br>Retail only !

**<br>Are you going to keep updating the addon for Retail?**
<br>I'm doing my best to keep the addon up to date, but it's challenging with all the recent changes from Blizzard :(
